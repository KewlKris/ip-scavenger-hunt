# Privacy Policy (As of 9/15/2021)

This extension handles sensitive information such as the user's location and web requests, however this data is **never** transferred to 3rd party servers
and it remains strictly confined to the user's device.  The purpose and usage of the sensitive information is detailed below:

## Geolocation

In order to properly animate web requests on the interactive globe, the user's location is requested and used by the extension. This location is then represented
on the globe with a green dot, and any animated pings added will originate from this location. This information is **never** saved to the local device or sent to 3rd party
servers.

## Web Requests

This extension monitors all web requests sent from any open browser tab to any web page connected to by the user. This is vital to the function of displaying
recent web requests on an interactive globe and providing statistics about the connected locations. This information is saved locally on the user's device so that
a connection history can be displayed by the extension. This information is **never** sent to 3rd party servers, and it can be cleared at any time through the extension's
options page.
